From a young age, music has been an integral part of my life. My formal studies began with music theory and classical guitar, providing a solid foundation that later inspired me to explore other instruments. I delved into the intricacies of drums and bass guitar through self-study, gaining a broader understanding of music in general.

My musical path then took an electronic turn. Starting as a DJ in my hometown, I became fascinated by the genre, which naturally led me to producing my own electronic music. This marked my initial steps into the world of music production and mixing.

Seeking further musical knowledge, I pursued more advanced music theory and picked up the trumpet. Playing in small ensembles and a local jazz big band allowed me to explore different musical styles and collaborate with other musicians.

Currently, I'm active as an electric guitar player, composer, and the recording engineer, mixer, and producer for a local band. This hands-on experience in all aspects of music creation continues to shape my approach to sound.

Driven by a constant desire to learn and grow, I'm currently teaching myself piano and deepening my understanding of mixing engineering. This ongoing exploration fuels my passion for helping other musicians achieve their sonic vision.
