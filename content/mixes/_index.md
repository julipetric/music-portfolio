This are examples of my work mixing provided multi-track material.

All of the examples here are taken from the Cambridge Music Technology's ["'Mixing Secrets' Free Multitrack Download Library"](https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/#topAnchor).
For better appreciation of the work done, for each song, you can compare in real time:
1. The track only setting the levels for each provided track, no further processing
2. The "preview" file provided by CMT's library
3. My finished mix (no mastering)

I also try to match the levels of each, to make the comparison fair.
