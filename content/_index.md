Based in Argentina, I'm a software engineer with a lifelong connection to music. My journey includes years playing rock guitar and jazz trumpet, followed by an exploration into electronic music and DJing. This personal involvement naturally evolved into recording and mixing music for friends, and now I'm looking to offer my mixing services to a wider audience.

Here, you can explore examples of my work, comparing the original tracks with the mixed material. My approach is straightforward: respect the source material and enhance it with an uncomplicated workflow, leaning on analog-style plugins to imbue your music with warmth and character.
